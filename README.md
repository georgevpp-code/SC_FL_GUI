This is a basic tutorial file for anyone who wants to get started with using the Flucoma Machine learning library in SuperCollider.
I've made a custom GUI and commented out instructions on using Machine learning for audio via this library. It's extremely useful for 
triggering events, making new musical instruments and especially when dealing with biosensor data. (I actually made this file to help 
myself deal with building Brain-computer interface based musical instruments)
